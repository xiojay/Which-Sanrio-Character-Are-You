## Technologies
This game includes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## Next Steps 
Some stretch goals I have for this game is to: 
- Add audio
    >Audio can enhance a users attention-span while playing the game
- Create a function that requires you to make a selection 
    >This game can be played without choosing an answer option, forcing a user to make an answer choice will help with accuracy of results
